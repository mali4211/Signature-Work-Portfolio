CG- Shapes & Curves 2
Repositories: 
https://github.com/mali4211/cg-shapescurves2.git
 
This was a project I did for my Computer Graphics class and the task for this was to create a slide show of shapes with line drawing and triangle filling using HTML's Canvas 2D API. It consists of 4 slides. For the project we were given access to a starter code for renderer.js and slideshow.js by the professor. Our task was to implement these files, create a css file for the styling and add images. The 4 slides consisted of Bezier Curves, Circles, Convex polygons and a draw your name part in which I had to write my name using atleast one stratigh line, one curve, one circle and one filled in polygon. This project took me about three to four days to make and was and indidual assignment. I really had fun making this and learned a lot for starters about computer graphics and how you can style your way around the screen with messing around with the code and drawing different shapes. A challenge I faced was in the last slide for the convex polygon filling which I had overcome by working my way through out and having precise calculations for the height and width. Overall this wasn't much of a big challenge since it was the first project of my Computer Graphics class.

CG - Fragment Shaders
Repositories: 
https://github.com/mali4211/cg-fragmentshaders.git

This was another individual project of the Computer Graphics class and a part of the final exam in which our task was to manipulate fragment shaders to create some cool effects using GLSL via Babylon's WebGL2 API. We had to convert a short clip into mp4 in order to get it running on the server so I picked a 5 second clip from the Lego Batman movie. The effects professor wanted to have were: Black & White, Fish Eye, Ripple, Toon and one additional effect of our own so I came up with the night vision effect. This was the last project for this class and it took me about two days to get done. The instructions for all the filters were already provided except the additional filter. It was mainly scale and translation accordance to luminance so the filters get applied precisely on the clip. I had somewhat of a challenge applying the toonify filter since the filter would round each color component to one of the 5 levels (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.0) but I worked my way out and was able to implement it perfectly. I really enjoyed this project animating a clip and made me have an idea on how animation can be done in such a fun and simple way yet challenging.

WebDev - St.Paul Crime Report
Repositories: 
https://github.com/pkjthao/webdev-rest.git

This was a group project with two other people I did for my Web-Development class and the task for this was to create a RESTful web server for St. Paul crime data. The server implemented a number of API routes relating to the data. The professor had already downloaded data from the St. Paul dataset located and stored them in a SQLite3 database. The database had 3 tables: Codes, Neighborhoods and Incidents. We had distributed the work into three people and my part was mainly in the backend to PUT /new incident in which I had to upload incident data that was going to be inserted into the SQLite3 database with a set of data fields and DELETE /remove-incident in which I had to remove data from the SQLite3 database with the data field; case_number being deleted. I also helped with the Get /incidents in which we had to return JSON object with list of crime incidents(ordered by date/time) and keeping in mind the date and time should be in separate fields. I also tested out everything in the end with my partner after finishing up the server. A challenge for this was to read data from the SQL file and linking it inside the server in a way it works precisely with our tasks. This project took me about 2 weeks to make and was a pretty challening one but I learned a lot of troubleshooting and collaborating with others to make things work.
